# Session Persistence Fix for Production

## Problem

When reloading the page in production, users were getting logged out. This was happening because:

1. The AuthContext was checking for localStorage tokens, but in production with PHP sessions, there are no localStorage tokens
2. The session validation was making unnecessary API calls
3. Session configuration wasn't properly set for production

## Solution

### 1. Fixed AuthContext (src/contexts/AuthContext.js)

- **Before**: Only checked localStorage for tokens
- **After**: Always tries server session first, then falls back to localStorage for development
- **Key Changes**:
  - Removed dependency on localStorage tokens for production
  - Added proper session validation flow
  - Improved error handling

### 2. Fixed API Service (src/services/api.js)

- **Before**: Made unnecessary second request to profile.php
- **After**: Uses session.php response directly since it already contains user data
- **Key Changes**:
  - Simplified getCurrentUser() to use session data directly
  - Added changePassword() function with fallback support
  - Improved error handling

### 3. Enhanced Session Configuration (api/db.php)

- **Added session security settings**:
  - `session.cookie_httponly = 1` - Prevents XSS attacks
  - `session.cookie_secure = 0` - Set to 1 in production with HTTPS
  - `session.cookie_samesite = 'Lax'` - CSRF protection
  - `session.gc_maxlifetime = 3600` - 1 hour session timeout
  - `session.cookie_lifetime = 0` - Session cookies

### 4. Improved Profile Management (api/profile.php)

- **Enhanced security**: Users can only access their own profiles (admins can access all)
- **Better error handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- **Consistent response format**: All responses follow the same structure

### 5. Added Password Change Support

- **Created api/change_password.php**: Secure password change endpoint
- **Added API service method**: changePassword() with localStorage fallback
- **Security features**: Current password verification, password validation

## How It Works Now

### Production (with PHP backend):

1. User logs in → PHP session created
2. Page reload → AuthContext calls getCurrentUser()
3. API service checks session.php → Returns user data from session
4. User stays logged in ✅

### Development (without PHP backend):

1. User logs in → localStorage token stored
2. Page reload → AuthContext calls getCurrentUser()
3. API service falls back to localStorage → Returns user data
4. User stays logged in ✅

## Testing

### Test Session Persistence:

```bash
# Run the test script
php test-session.php
```

### Manual Testing:

1. Login to the application
2. Reload the page
3. Verify user remains logged in
4. Check browser developer tools for session cookies

## Files Modified

- `src/contexts/AuthContext.js` - Fixed session validation
- `src/services/api.js` - Improved getCurrentUser and added changePassword
- `api/db.php` - Added session configuration
- `api/profile.php` - Enhanced security and error handling
- `api/change_password.php` - New password change endpoint
- `test-session.php` - Session testing script

## Security Improvements

- Session cookies are HttpOnly (XSS protection)
- SameSite cookies (CSRF protection)
- Proper session timeout
- User authorization checks
- Input validation and sanitization

The application now maintains user sessions properly in both development and production environments, with automatic fallback to localStorage when the PHP backend is unavailable.
